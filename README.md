#Hack Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

This project matches most aspects of Hack Machine Language (also known as HML) syntax. The syntax highlighting works for Sublime Text as well as Textmate.

Hack.tmLanguage is what you want to actually get the syntax highlighting. Hack.YAML-tmLanguage is a higher level abstraction that is converted to usable tmLanguage, or something.
